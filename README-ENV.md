## Environment Setup

1. Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root.
2. Add the following variables:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

Notes:
- `.env.local` is ignored by git. Do not commit real secrets.
- For Vercel, set the same variable in Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables.
